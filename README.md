CLIENT APPLICATION <br>
This project consists of a website for an electronics store (TechTrove). <br>
The website fetches data from an API application which has 50 rows of data (imported from a csv file). When the user enters the product id, the information is passed to the API application, and the data of that particular product with the given product id is fetched. The details of the product are shown to the user.
